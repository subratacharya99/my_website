# My Personal Website

This is my portfolio website where I showcase my work as a Software Engineer. Built it from scratch with React and TypeScript because I wanted something that actually represents me, not just another template.

## What's Inside

**About Me**: A bit about my background and what drives me as a developer  
**Experience**: My work at Avantor and iotaMotion, including the cool projects I've shipped  
**Skills**: All the tech I work with (Python, Go, React, AWS, and more)  
**Education**: My degree from the University of Iowa  
**Personal**: Photos of my cats Mello & Lucy, plus my sister's dog Mimi (because why not?)  
**Contact**: How to reach me if you want to chat about work or just say hi  

## Tech Stack

I built this with:
- React 18 & TypeScript (because type safety is life)
- Framer Motion for the smooth animations
- Custom CSS with dark/light themes
- GitHub Pages for hosting (free and simple!)

The site has some fun interactive elements - you can drag my profile picture around, and there's a theme toggle if you prefer dark mode.

## Running Locally

If you want to check out the code:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and you should see everything running.

## Deployment

The site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes. Pretty neat setup:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds everything and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## About the Code

The whole thing is built with Create React App, so it's got all the standard React tooling. Each section is its own component, and I tried to keep the styling modular. The animations are done with Framer Motion - they're subtle but add a nice touch.

Feel free to poke around the code if you're interested. I learned a lot building this, especially about making things look good on mobile (harder than it seems!).
